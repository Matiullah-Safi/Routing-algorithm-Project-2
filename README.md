# 🌐 Prim's Algorithm Routing Visualizer

A Java-based interactive visualizer for **Prim's Algorithm** using **JavaFX** and **GraphStream**. This program allows users to input or modify graphs, compute a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and visualize routing paths between two nodes.

## 🧠 Features

- Visual implementation of **Prim’s Algorithm**.
- Supports **custom or default graphs**.
- Interactive graph modification: add/remove nodes or edges.
- Live recomputation and visualization of MST and paths.
- Highlights:
  - MST edges in green
  - Shortest path in red
  - Path nodes in blue

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 💻 Java 8+
- 🎨 JavaFX
- 📊 GraphStream
- 🧱 IntelliJ IDEA (IDE used for development)
